## SVGeezy
# A JavaScript plugin to handle browsers that don't support SVGs

SVGeezy is in essence, a fallback plugin. It allows you to use SVGs for all your assets, giving you complete resolution independence, while it checks if the browser supports SVGs and if not, changes the _src_ of the image to a _.png_ instead (or whatever you pass in).
